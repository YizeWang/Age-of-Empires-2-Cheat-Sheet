# Age of Empires 2 (DE) Cheat Sheet

Since the default keyboard shortcuts are either hard to remember or too far to press, I rearranged some hotkeys based on the locations and names. The key idea is to make the frequently-used hotkeys easily reachable with the left hand or use the initial letter of the name. Further, I include some strategies (build orders) to help beginners get a quick and well-organized start.

# Keyboard Shortcuts

- Unit Commands
- Game Commands
- Cycle Commands
- Chat Options
- Military Units Commands
- Town Center Commands
- Villager Build

# Strategies

- 26+2 Arena Fast Castle
- 22 Scout Rush
- 28+2 Fast Castle with Unique Unit
- 27+2 Fast Castle - Boom
